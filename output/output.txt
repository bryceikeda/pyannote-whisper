example0  I think if you're a leader and you don't understand the terms that you're using, that's probably the first start.
example0  It's really important that as a leader in the organisation you understand what digitisation means.
example0  You take the time to read widely in the sector.
example0  There are a lot of really good books, Kevin Kelly, who started Wired magazine has written a great book on various technologies.
example0  I think understanding the technologies, understanding what's out there so that you can separate the hype from the hope is really an important first step.
example0  And then making sure you understand the relevance of that for your function and how that fits into your business is the second step.
example1  I think two simple suggestions.
example1  One is I love the phrase brilliant at the basics.
example1  How can you become brilliant at the basics?
example1  But beyond that, the fundamental thing I've seen which hasn't changed is so few organisations as a first step have truly taken control of their spend data.
example1  As a key first step on a digital transformation, taking ownership of data.
example1  That's not a decision to use one vendor over someone else.
example1  That says we are going to be completely data driven, we're going to try and be as real time as possible.
example1  And we're going to be able to explain that data to anyone the way they want to see it.
example4  Understand why you're doing it.
example4  And then the second thing is reach out to suppliers in the market, talk to them, collaborate with them, you'll get a much better outcome.
example3  Think about what outcome you want at the end instead of thinking about the different processes and their software names, so e-sourcing being one of 20.
example3  And beer can be brave, I think, and talk to technology vendors because rather than just sending them forms, we won't bite you.
example2  I think we should fundamentally, all of us, rethink how procurement should be done and then start to define the functionality that we need and how we can make this work.
example2  What we do today is absolutely wrong.
example2  We don't like it, we're killing people don't like it, our colleagues don't like it.
example2  Nobody wants it and we're spending a huge amount of money for no reason.
